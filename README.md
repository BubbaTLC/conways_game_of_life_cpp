# Welcome to Conway's Game of Life C++

This repository is for an ambitious project I thought of as a challenge for myself. I learnt C while is school ~1 year from writing this readme in June 2021. I figured I should finally look into C++ and have some fun while doing so. I will be making the famous Conway's Game of Life from scratch with no tutorial. I have always been interested in the game but have never made it or even played it myself, even though it is a 0 player game.

The game boils down to four simple rules:

1. Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbours dies, as if by under-population.
2. Any live cell with two or three live neighbours lives on to the next generation.
3. Any live cell with more than three live neighbours dies, as if by overpopulation.
4. Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbours becomes a live cell, as if by reproduction.

My plan is to make a game with a tool bar and a game play region. The game will also alow for the game to be paused and cells added and removed via mouse click, as well as the capability to speed up and slow down. Once core game play is added I will add some customization abilities like different color modes. With millennial theme (Dark Mode) being the default of course.

This will definitely be a long endeavour but I look forward to using my own brain for once. Instead of just watching a video tutorial of a game being made then implementing my own game.
